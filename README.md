# Raw-Gestures

An Arduino project which is based on controlling video functions using gestures with three axis accelerometer

## Raw Gesture is an Arduino based project used to control the function in videos.
## We are using a 3 axis Accelerometer

### We have a total of 4 gestures.

1. Moving the accelerometer in the right direction , we can fast forward the video.
1. Moving the accelerometer in the left direction , we can rewind the video.
3. Moving the accelerometer in the upward direction , we can increase the volume of the video.
4. Moving the accelerometer in the downward direction , we can decrease the volume of the video.
